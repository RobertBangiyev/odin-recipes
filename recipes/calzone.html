        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A calzone (UK: /kælˈtsoʊni, -neɪ/, US: /kælˈzoʊn, -zoʊneɪ, -ni/, Italian: [kalˈtsoːne]; "stocking" or "trouser") is an 
            Italian oven-baked folded pizza, often described as a turnover, made with leavened dough. It originated in Naples in the 
            18th century. A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and is stuffed with salami, ham or 
            vegetables, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, as well as an egg. Different regional variations in or 
            on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings. The term usually 
            applies to an oven-baked turnover rather than a fried pastry (i.e. panzerotti), though calzoni and panzerotti are often 
            mistaken for each other.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the oil, sugar and salt; mix in 1 cup of the flour until 
                smooth. Gradually stir in the rest of the flour, until dough is smooth and workable. Knead dough on a lightly floured 
                surface for about 5 minutes, or until it is elastic. Lay dough in a bowl containing 1 teaspoon olive oil, then flip 
                the dough, cover and let rise for 40 minutes, or until almost doubled.
            </li>
            <li>
                To Make Filling: While dough is rising, combine the ricotta cheese, Cheddar cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and basil 
                leaves in a large bowl. Mix well, cover bowl and refrigerate to chill.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                When dough is ready, punch it down and separate it into 2 equal parts. Roll parts out into thin circles on a lightly 
                floured surface. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese/meat filling and fold over, securing edges by folding in and 
                pressing with a fork. Brush the top of each calzone with egg and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
